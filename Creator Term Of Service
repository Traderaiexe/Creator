Using the bot implies full acceptance of these Terms of Service (TOS).

The bot is intended solely for Discord servers that comply with Discord’s TOS and Developer Policies.

The bot is not intended for users under 13 and follows Discord’s age and safety guidelines.

1. Eligibility

    You must have a valid Discord account and comply with Discord’s TOS.

    Server administrators are responsible for proper bot configuration and granted permissions.

2. Required Permissions To function correctly, the bot requires the following permissions:

    Send Messages

    Read Message History

    Add Reactions

    View Channel

    If the “voice voting” feature is enabled: Move Members

Permissions must be limited to the necessary channels/contexts. The use of these permissions and the related data processing are detailed in our Privacy Policy.

3. Permitted Use

    Use commands in servers; commands in DMs are disabled.

    Moderation functions conform to Discord APIs (e.g., purge of recent messages).

    Social/utility functions must respect policy and API rate limits.

4. Prohibited Conduct You are strictly prohibited from:

    Using the bot as a self-bot or automations that simulate users.

    Mass DM, spam, data scraping outside the server, or collection of sensitive content.

    Attempts to bypass rate limits or Discord permissions.

    Use for harassment, hate speech, illegal activities, or privacy violations.

5. Server Responsibility

    Admins must correctly configure permissions and features (e.g., enabling “voice voting” for specific guilds).

    The server is responsible for informing users about active features and internal policies.

6. Availability and Changes

    The bot is provided “as-is”; continuous availability or error-free operation is not guaranteed.

    Features may change or be retired without notice for technical or compliance reasons.

    These TOS may be updated; continued use of the bot constitutes acceptance of changes.

7. Limitation of Liability

    The bot and its authors are not liable for indirect damages, data loss, service interruptions, or consequences arising from misconfiguration of the server.

    Server admins remain responsible for local policies and bot usage within their context.

8. Governing Law

    Bot usage is subject to Discord’s TOS and applicable laws on data protection and cybersecurity.

    In case of conflict between these TOS and Discord’s TOS, Discord’s TOS prevail.
